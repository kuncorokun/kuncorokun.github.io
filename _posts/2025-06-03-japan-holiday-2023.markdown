It was windy that day. It also cloudy, but I like that I can see the lake and mount fuji clear enough

I eat this when arrived at Kawaguchiko Station. The portion is really HUGE, but it fills belly until night and warm my body

This is one of the room from Tokiwaso manga museum. This museum recreated from the same house that was used by mangaka in the past to gather and create mangas.
